## Inspiration
Novus is inspired by the idea of Facebook Camera Platform. We think with this kind of platform, we can make a new kind of interaction experiences. We also inspired by the creation of Facebook VR Room which is a new kind of social media with VR technology.
Our goal is building a new social network where people can see other people's Augmented Reality contents that are attached with the objects around their location. We are hoping that Novus can drive people go outside and do offline interaction more with other people around their location. This also leads people to form a community based on content and interest around their location.

## What it does
Novus lets users to post Augmented Reality contents into the object around the users location. For example, a user attends F8 and she uses Novus to post an AR content with the front building of McEnery Convention Centre as background. The content is posted, but other people can only see the AR content when they scan the front building of McEnery with Novus.

## How we built it
We built the prototype using Unity3D, Vuforia, and we also use Facebook Login. 

## Challenges we ran into
This application is really hard to develop in just around 18 hours. But we managed to build the AR content viewer part and Facebook Login.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learnt much and we really having fun at this hackathon. Most of us never develop app with Unity3D and Vuforia and yet we manage to built the prototype.

## What we learned
We learnt many things today, for example, building AR app with Unity and Vuforia. 

## What's next for Novus
This idea will work better besides Facebook Camera. The Facebook Camera AR content creator is already mature. And together, we can make world a better place.
